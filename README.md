# Arduino-Sensirion-SDP3x-driver
An arduino driver to interface the Sensirion SDP3x differential pressure sensor over I2C

This is currently a work in progress, the code was done during the MakeZurich hackathon and directly used in the project.
I try to sort it out and add all the funcitonality of the sensor as well as writing my first arduino library ;-)

Short documentation can be found on http://rac.su/libs/sensirion-sdp3x-driver

As I first used a SDP610 and a library I found on github I adhered the style from the SDP6x library from Antony Burness, but replaced the code with the sample code from Sensirion for the SDP3x
